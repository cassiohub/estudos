idiots javascript craps

nodeTypes use numbers 1 = element 3 = textNode
	it could return a string;
	it could return 0 or 1 (more meaningful numbers);

nodeValue returns null for elements

nodeName return not consistent: sometimes lowercase, sometimes uppercase

there is a insertBefore, but there isn't a insertAfter;

var monkeyWindow = window.open("monk.html", "win1", "width=420,height=380");
	no spaces on window name (second parameter) and on size definition
